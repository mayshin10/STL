Sequence Containers
--------------------------------------
A sequence container is a container that stores objects of the same type in a linear arrangement. These are the functions supported by the Sequence containers in this library.

Adapter Containers
--------------------------------------
Adaptor Containers(Container adpators) provide a different interface for sequential containers. 

Associative Containers
--------------------------------------
Associative containers access an element using a key. They implement sorted data structures that can be queickly serached (O(log n) complexity).
